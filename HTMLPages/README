HomeFood
By:Aaron Thomas

HomeFood is a website that links people looking for home-cooked food with people who can provide it. Often times, life moves very fast and we are forced to consume food by from three general mediums: cafeterias or dining halls, quick meals bought from groceries or pre-made meals, and going out to eat. I define these three eating environments as quick food, food that is eaten due to necessity, not to make you feel good, or to introduce friendship and conversation. I am going to change this system.

HomeFood is the alternative.
